# Build-a-Bot

This project involves building a robot that uses IR (infra-red) sensors to detect the presence of any obstacle. 
<p>
The robot moves in  a linear direction.While the robot is moving if any obstacle is detected by the sensor, robot stops moving and the LED is connected to the robot is switched off. The LED lights up, and the robot starts moving again when the obstacle is removed.
 <p>
Obstacle detection robot can be used for purposes which involve searching for objects which are smaller than what a human eye can detect. It can also find its use in automatic vacuum cleaners, which help us clean our surrounding, without unwanted collisions.
